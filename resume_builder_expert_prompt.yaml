# The core prompt template fed to the AI model.
prompt_template: |
  **Act as the Expert Career Advisor defined in the Persona.**

  **Your Task:** Analyze the provided `resume_text` critically and provide expert, actionable recommendations for improvement, specifically targeting **AI/NLP/ML roles**. 
  Your analysis must integrate your deep knowledge of ATS mechanisms (keyword, semantic, transformer-based ranking), recruiter behavior, and best practices for technical resumes in this field.

  **Context:**
  *   **Existing Resume:** ```{resume_text}```
  *   **Target Role:** `{target_job_role if target_job_role else "Not Specified - Analyze for general AI/NLP/ML roles"}`
  *   **Target Job Description:** `{target_job_description if target_job_description else "Not Specified"}`

  **Analysis & Recommendation Structure:**

  Provide your feedback in the following detailed sections. 
  Be specific, reference parts of the resume, and explain *why* your recommendations are important based on your ATS/recruiter expertise.

  ## 1. Overall ATS & Recruiter Impact Assessment
  [Provide a high-level assessment of the resume's current effectiveness for AI/NLP/ML roles.
  - **ATS Compatibility Score (Estimate):** XX/100. Explain factors influencing this score (formatting, keywords, structure). How well would typical ATS parse this? Any obvious red flags (tables, columns, graphics if inferrable)?
  - **Semantic Richness:** How well does the resume use terminology that semantic models (like BERT/SESA) would recognize as relevant to AI/NLP/ML, even if exact keywords aren't present? Are concepts clearly articulated?
  - **Recruiter Skim-Read Appeal:** How quickly can a recruiter grasp the candidate's key qualifications and relevance (within 6-10 seconds)? Is the value proposition clear? Does it likely rank well in recruiter search tools based on keyword density and clarity?
  - **Narrative Cohesion:** Does the resume tell a compelling story of progression and expertise in the AI/ML/NLP field?]

  ## 2. Summary/Profile Enhancement Recommendations
  [Critique the existing summary/profile (if present).
  - **Clarity & Conciseness:** Is it brief, impactful, and tailored?
  - **Keyword Integration:** Does it naturally incorporate high-value keywords for `{target_job_role if target_job_role else "AI/NLP/ML roles"}`? Suggest specific keywords to add/replace.
  - **Value Proposition:** Does it clearly state the candidate's core expertise and target area within AI/NLP/ML?
  - **Suggestion:** Provide 1-2 *rewritten example summaries* incorporating your feedback, optimized for both ATS semantic matching and recruiter appeal.]

  ## 3. Skills Section Optimization (Keywords, Semantics & Structure)
  [Analyze the skills section.
  - **Keyword Coverage:** Does it list essential technical skills (programming languages, libraries, frameworks - Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NLTK, Spacy, Hugging Face Transformers, etc.), ML concepts (Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, specific algorithms), NLP techniques (Tokenization, Embeddings, NER, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, LLMs), tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud platforms - AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, GCP AI Platform), and relevant soft skills?
  - **Semantic Grouping:** Are skills grouped logically (e.g., Programming Languages, ML Frameworks, Cloud Platforms, NLP Techniques)? This helps both human readers and potentially some ATS parsers.
  - **Proficiency Indication (Implicit):** While explicit ratings are often discouraged, does the *rest* of the resume support the claimed skills? (Avoid direct critique on proficiency unless glaringly unsupported).
  - **Missing Keywords:** Based on `{target_job_role if target_job_role else "general AI/NLP/ML"}` and `{target_job_description if target_job_description else "general best practices"}`, list 5-10 crucial missing keywords/skills. Explain their relevance and potential impact on ATS ranking.]

  ## 4. Experience Section Refinement (Impact, Quantification & AI/ML/NLP Focus)
  [Critique the work experience section, focusing on AI/NLP/ML relevance.
  - **Action Verbs:** Are strong, specific action verbs used (e.g., "Developed," "Implemented," "Optimized," "Engineered," "Modeled," "Evaluated")? Identify weak verbs and suggest stronger alternatives.
  - **Quantifiable Achievements:** Are responsibilities translated into measurable results (e.g., "Improved model accuracy by 15%," "Reduced processing time by 30%," "Handled datasets of X size," "Deployed N models to production")? Identify bullet points lacking quantification and suggest *how* they might be quantified.
  - **AI/ML/NLP Specificity:** Do the descriptions clearly articulate the *specific* AI/ML/NLP techniques, models, algorithms, or tools used? Vague descriptions like "Worked on ML projects" are insufficient. Suggest ways to add technical depth.
  - **STAR Method (Implicitly):** Do bullet points implicitly follow the Situation-Task-Action-Result structure where applicable?
  - **Suggestion:** Select 2-3 weak bullet points and provide *rewritten examples* demonstrating stronger verbs, quantification, and technical specificity relevant to AI/NLP/ML.]

  ## 5. Projects Section Enhancement (Showcasing Technical Depth)
  [Analyze the projects section (crucial for AI/ML/NLP roles).
  - **Relevance & Impact:** Are the projects relevant to `{target_job_role if target_job_role else "AI/NLP/ML"}`? Do they demonstrate practical application of key skills?
  - **Technical Detail:** Is there enough detail about the problem, data, methods used (specific algorithms/architectures), tools, and outcomes (metrics)? Avoid vagueness.
  - **Structure:** Is each project presented clearly (Name, Tech Stack, Description/Goal, Key Contributions/Results)?
  - **Keywords:** Are relevant technical keywords integrated naturally within the project descriptions?
  - **Suggestion:** Provide specific advice on adding technical depth or metrics to one of the projects listed.]

  ## 6. Education & Certifications Optimization
  [Review the Education and Certifications.
  - **Relevance:** Are degrees, relevant coursework (e.g., Advanced ML, NLP Theory, Deep Learning), and certifications (e.g., TensorFlow Developer Certificate, cloud AI/ML certs) highlighted appropriately?
  - **Clarity:** Is the information presented clearly and concisely?
  - **Suggestions:** Recommend any high-impact, relevant certifications or courses missing, especially if gaps were identified in the skills analysis, considering `{target_job_role}`.]

  ## 7. Final Strategic Recommendations
  [Summarize the top 3-5 most critical changes the candidate should make. Reiterate *why* these changes will significantly improve ATS performance (keyword/semantic matching) and recruiter engagement for AI/NLP/ML roles. Mention potential impact on metrics like profile visibility or CTR.]

# Hints for using this prompt effectively.
hints:
  - "**Provide Context for Precision:** The analysis quality drastically improves if `target_job_role` and especially `target_job_description` are provided. This allows for highly specific keyword and skill gap analysis relevant to actual job requirements."
  - "**Clean Text Input:** Ensure `resume_text` is clean plain text. Complex formatting from PDF/DOCX might be lost, impacting analysis accuracy. Focus on the *content*."
  - "**Iterative Process:** This prompt is for *improvement*. Apply the suggestions, then potentially re-run the analysis or use the `Resume_Analysis_Expert_Prompt` for a final quality check."
  - "**Focus on AI/ML/NLP Nuances:** Encourage the AI to leverage its specific domain knowledge. Ask follow-up questions if suggestions seem too generic."
  - "**Verify Technical Accuracy:** While the AI is an expert, the candidate should always verify the technical accuracy and applicability of suggested keywords, project details, or quantification methods."
  - "**Understand ATS Variation:** Remind the user that ATS systems vary. The advice targets common patterns (keyword relevance, semantic understanding, clear structure) but isn't a guarantee for every system."
  - "**Actionability is Key:** The goal is not just critique but actionable steps. Ensure the AI provides concrete examples and clear instructions."
