## Guide to Bypassing LinkedIn Blocking in Russia (2025)

### Overview

As of 2025, LinkedIn remains blocked in Russia due to regulatory conflicts related to data localization laws. 
This guide provides a reliable and secure method for bypassing LinkedIn censorship in Russia as of 2025. Traditional methods such as generic VPN usage or pre-registered accounts often fail due to CAPTCHA loops, SMS verification issues, and anti-abuse mechanisms resulting in account bans.

Using the method described in this guide, users in Russia can **successfully access LinkedIn** and **create authentic, long-term usable accounts** without being flagged or blocked.
The method has been validated through real-world testing and is intended for ethical use only.

#### 1. Problem Analysis

##### Observed Issues

- **VPN usage** results in:
  - Cyclic CAPTCHA verification during login or registration.
  - Increased likelihood of triggering LinkedIn's anti-abuse systems (e.g., account bans marked as `Access to your account has been temporarily restricted`).
- **Free virtual phone numbers** are blacklisted and **ineffective** for SMS verification.
- **Pre-registered accounts** from marketplaces are flagged and banned.

#### 2. Recommended Bypass Strategy

##### 2.1. Traffic Obfuscation and DNS Privacy

To bypass both IP-based and DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) censorship techniques, follow these steps:

###### ‚úÖ Step 1: Set up Advanced VPN + Obfuscation

- **Use a VPN that supports**:
  - Shadowsocks with TLS+WebSocket or XTLS-RPRX.
  - V2Ray with `VMess` or `VLESS` protocols and `tls+ws` over port 443.
  - `frpc` (reverse proxy over HTTPS) if you're self-hosting.
- Choose **stable exit nodes** in Countries of the European Union (EU) (e.g., Spain, Estonia) to reduce CAPTCHA triggers.

###### ‚úÖ Step 2: Use Custom DNS with DoH/DoT

- Configure DNS to **Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)** or **NextDNS** via **DoH (DNS over HTTPS)** .

###### 2.2. Account Registration Method

###### ‚úÖ Step 3: Register a LinkedIn Account (New User)

- Use the **Desktop version** of LinkedIn (or used the mobile app).
- Ensure:
  - Same **VPN IP address** throughout registration and first login sessions.
  - Clean browser profile (no cookies or extensions; consider Incognito or a container profile).
- **Important:** Avoid automation tools or password managers that autofill.

###### ‚úÖ Step 4: Pass Phone Number Verification

- DO NOT use free SMS services ‚Äî they are universally blocked.
- Average cost: **20‚Äì25‚ÇΩ (~$0.20‚Äì$0.30 USD)**

- After successful registration:
  - LinkedIn **does not bind** the initial SMS number permanently.
  - You can link a **Russian mobile number** after verifying the account.

- Recommended services:
  - **smshub.org**
  - **sms-activate.org**
 - **simsms.org** (LinkedIn - most of the numbers in the block)

#### 2.3. Post-Registration Hardening

###### ‚úÖ Step 5: Link Real Russian Number

- After successful login and email confirmation, add your real Russian phone number.
- LinkedIn will send a one-time SMS for verification.
- This helps with account recovery and builds trust in your account‚Äôs behavior.

###### ‚úÖ Step 6: Sync Login Sessions

- Log in from both **Desktop and Mobile App** **using the same VPN IP address**.
- This prevents LinkedIn‚Äôs behavior analytics system from flagging your login pattern as suspicious.

#### 3. Additional Recommendations

##### üîí Operational Security (OpSec)

- Avoid switching VPN servers frequently during the first 7 days.
- Use a **dedicated browser profile** or a hardened mobile device for LinkedIn only.
- Do not install the app from **non-official sources** (e.g., third-party APK sites).

---

#### 4. Important Notes

- **Avoid using stolen or mass-sold accounts**. These are likely to be blacklisted.
- **Use strong passwords and MFA** (multi-factor authentication) after registration.
- LinkedIn **may periodically request re-verification** via phone/email ‚Äî ensure access remains.
