## Prompts Overview

This project includes two distinct prompt templates:

1.  **`Resume_Builder_Expert_Prompt` (v1.1):**
    *   **Goal:** To analyze an existing resume and provide highly specific, actionable **recommendations for improvement and rewriting**.
    *   **Output:** Focuses on suggesting *how* to enhance different sections (Summary, Skills, Experience, Projects, Education) with rewritten examples, keyword suggestions, and quantification advice, all tailored for AI/ML/NLP roles and ATS optimization.

2.  **`Resume_Analysis_Expert_Prompt` (v1.2):**
    *   **Goal:** To perform a comprehensive, deep-level **analysis and assessment** of the resume's current state and effectiveness.
    *   **Output:** Provides a structured report including overall assessment, detailed analysis of each section (including skills inventory and proficiency estimation), identification of strengths and weaknesses, ATS optimization checks (with score), course/certification recommendations, an overall resume score, and *conditional analyses* comparing the resume against a specific target role or job description if provided.

## Persona Details

The AI acts as an **Expert Career Advisor & Resume Strategist** with:
*   Specialization in AI/NLP/ML recruitment.
*   Experience in Talent Acquisition for top tech companies.
*   Technical understanding of modern ATS (keyword, semantic, transformer-based).
*   Awareness of recruiter metrics and behaviors (search ranking factors, CTR, quantification value).

## Input Variables

Both prompts utilize the following input variables:

*   `resume_text` (**Required**): The full plain text content of the candidate's resume.
*   `target_job_role` / `job_role` (**Optional, Highly Recommended**): The specific job title the candidate is targeting (e.g., "Machine Learning Engineer", "NLP Scientist").
*   `target_job_description` / `job_description` (**Optional, Highly Recommended**): The full text of a specific job description the candidate is interested in.

**Note:** Providing the optional variables significantly enhances the specificity and accuracy of the AI's feedback, especially regarding keyword alignment, skill gaps, and ATS performance for a particular target.

## How to Use

1.  **Choose the Right Prompt:**
    *   Use `Resume_Builder_Expert_Prompt` when you want specific guidance on *how to rewrite and improve* your resume sections.
    *   Use `Resume_Analysis_Expert_Prompt` when you want a detailed *assessment* of your resume's current strengths, weaknesses, ATS compatibility, and alignment with specific roles/jobs.
2.  **Prepare Inputs:**
    *   Extract the **plain text** from your resume. Avoid submitting formatted text directly from PDF/DOCX if possible, as formatting can interfere with analysis. Focus on the content.
    *   Identify a specific `target_job_role` if you have one.
    *   Copy the full text of a relevant `target_job_description` if available.
3.  **Execute the Prompt:** Provide the inputs to the chosen prompt template within your LLM interface.
4.  **Review the Output:** Carefully read the AI's analysis and recommendations.
5.  **Implement & Iterate:**
    *   Apply the actionable suggestions to improve your resume.
    *   Consider using the `Resume_Analysis_Expert_Prompt` after making changes suggested by the `Resume_Builder_Expert_Prompt` to assess the improvements.
6.  **Verify:** Always use your own judgment and verify the technical accuracy of suggestions. The AI provides expert *guidance*, but the candidate is the final owner of the resume content.
7.  **Leverage Context:** Remember that providing the `target_job_role` and `target_job_description` unlocks the most powerful and tailored feedback, especially the conditional analysis sections in `Resume_Analysis_Expert_Prompt`.

#### Getting Started

When crafting prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate or update resumes, both explicit variable specification and interactive input methods have their distinct advantages. The choice between them depends on the desired level of control, user engagement, and the complexity of the task.

**Explicit Variable Specification:**

By clearly defining variables such as [Target Role], [Target Industry], and [Current Resume] within the prompt, you provide the LLM with structured and comprehensive context. This approach ensures that the model understands the specific requirements upfront, leading to more accurate and tailored responses. Explicit prompts reduce ambiguity, allowing the model to focus on generating content that aligns closely with the provided parameters. This method is particularly effective when the input data is complete and well-defined.​

**Interactive, Step-by-Step Input:**

Engaging in a dynamic dialogue with the LLM, where information is gathered iteratively, can enhance the depth and relevance of the generated resume. This method, known as interactive or progressive prompting, allows for real-time clarification and refinement of details. It is especially beneficial when dealing with complex scenarios or when the initial information is incomplete. By breaking down the task into manageable steps, the model can address each aspect thoroughly, leading to a more personalized and accurate output. This approach mirrors the concept of "Chain-of-Thought Prompting," where complex problems are divided into logical steps, facilitating better reasoning and coherence in responses. ​

**Combining Both Approaches:**

Integrating explicit variable specification with interactive input can leverage the strengths of both methods. Starting with a structured prompt to establish the foundational context, followed by interactive exchanges to refine and elaborate on specific details, can result in a highly customized and effective resume. This hybrid approach ensures that the LLM has a clear understanding of the core requirements while remaining flexible to adapt to additional information or changes provided during the interaction.​

**Conclusion:**

Both explicit variable specification and interactive input methods are suitable for creating or updating resumes using LLMs. The optimal choice depends on the specific use case:​

- Use explicit variables when you have all necessary information upfront and seek a straightforward, structured output.​
- Opt for interactive input when details are evolving, require clarification, or when a more personalized approach is desired.​

By understanding and applying these prompting techniques, you can effectively guide LLMs to produce resumes that are well-aligned with targeted roles and industries.​
