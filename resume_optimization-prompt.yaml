    Optimizing with {ATS Optimization Options} {ProfileType} (CV or LinkedIn) to showcase most relevant skills and achievements. Follow this workflow:
    1. Gather & Organize
        - Prompt me to upload or paste my current resume
        - Extract every detail—education, work experience, skills, certifications, projects, volunteer work—and structure them into categories.
        - Save this as $resume_data.
    2. Draft a Base Resume
        - Using $resume_data, generate a clean, ATS‑friendly resume with:
            ▪ Header: Name, contact info, professional title/area of expertise.
            ▪ Sections: Professional Summary, Skills, Work Experience, Education, Additional Information.
        - Emphasize clarity, quantifiable achievements, and alignment with my stated career goals.
        - Save this as $base_resume.
    3. Customize per Job
        - For each job description I provide:
            ▪ Identify its key terms, required skills, and priorities.
            ▪ Tailor $base_resume to mirror those keywords, highlight matching achievements, and optimize section order.
        - Save each tailored version as $custom_resume.
    4. Proofread & Polish
        - Review $custom_resume for spelling, grammar, formatting, and style consistency (plain‑text compatibility, consistent date formats, no tables/text‑boxes).
        - Suggest peer review or professional proofreading if needed.
        - Save the final version as $final_resume.

    Produce the complete resume in Markdown or plain text.
    At the end of the document, provide an "ATS Score Estimate" (0–100) along with a brief explanation of the factors contributing to this score, focusing on aspects like keyword optimization, formatting adherence, and semantic relevance.
    
ATS Optimization Options:
  - Keyword Alignment: |
      Integrate exact job description keywords into headings and bullet points to enhance ATS keyword matching.
  - Structured Formatting: |
      For CV: Structure sections (Contact, Summary, Skills, Experience, Education & Certifications) to align with ATS parsing best practices (chronological order, consistent date formats, no headers/footers).
      For LinkedIn: Structure sections (Headline, About, Experience, Skills, Projects & Publications, Languages, Career Interests) to align with ATS parsing best practices (chronological order, consistent date formats, no headers/footers).
      Ensure chronological ordering, consistent date formats (YYYY-MM), and avoid the use of headers, footers, tables, or text boxes to facilitate accurate ATS parsing.
  - Quantifiable Achievements: |
      Highlight performance-based accomplishments with specific metrics (e.g., "Increased system uptime by 20%", "Reduced deployment time from 3 hours to 30 minutes").
  - Semantic Enrichment: |
      Utilize synonyms and industry-specific terminology recognized by semantic models like BERT/SESA to capture latent relevance and improve semantic similarity scoring.
  - Professional Summary: |
      Craft a concise, keyword-optimized summary of 3–4 lines that encapsulates your professional expertise and aligns with the target role.
  - Skills Prioritization: |
      List hard skills and certifications prominently at the beginning of the Skills section. Include soft skills supported by contextual evidence within the Experience section.
  - ATS-Friendly Formatting: |
      Use simple fonts, minimal graphics, and avoid complex formatting elements to ensure compatibility with ATS. (Jobscan)
  - Projects & Publications: |
      If applicable, add a section for Projects & Publications with links to public repositories or published papers to provide verifiable evidence of your work.
  - Bias Mitigation: |
      Employ neutral language to promote fairness and avoid unconscious bias (e.g., use "Managed a team of 5" instead of "Led a female team").
  - International Standards Compliance: |
      Exclude personal information such as photographs, date of birth, and nationality. Use UK or US English spelling as appropriate for the job location.
